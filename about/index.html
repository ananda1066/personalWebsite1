			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I am currently a freshman at University of California, Davis pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. In my free time, I enjoy programming, singing, and reading. I am familiar with Java, Python, C, and C++ and learning HTML/CSS at the moment. I am actively seeking software engineer internships and research opportunities to further supplement my computer science education. My biggest accomplishment is a startup I formed a year ago with three classmates called TileWarp (<a href="http://tilewarp.com">tilewarp.com</a>). We released a game app in the Google Play Store. Thanks for reading and look at my <a href="/cv">CV</a> for more information!</p>
